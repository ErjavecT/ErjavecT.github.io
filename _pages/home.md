<p>Hello! Welcome to my personal webpage where I share my research that consumes my professional life, and my various projects which consumes whatever is left.</p>

<p>I am a currently a PhD Candidate physicist who is pasionate about combining theoretical concepts with novel instrumentation! Being in lab is where I feel most at home.</p>

## Research
<div class="div-1" markdown="1">
<br>
<p>My research primarily is focused towards rare event detection of dark matter and neutrinos - I am involved in both the Darkside20k and DUNE experiments, where I work with Prof. Emilija Pantic at the University of California Davis.</p>

<p>DarkSide-20k is a 20-ton liquid argon dual-phase time projection chamber located in the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy. It is designed to detect dark matter particles that interact with the nuclei of the argon atoms. I am involved in the development of the high-voltage delivery system.</p>

<p>DUNE is a 1,000,000 ton liquid argon time projection chamber located in the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, whose neutrino beam is created at FermiLab, just outside of Chicago. DUNE is the premier next-generation experiment whose goal is pin down the exact nature of neutrinos. I am involved in a supporting ancillary experiment called ARTIE, which helped better understand neutron transport in liquid argon.</p> </div>



## Personal Projects
<div class="div-1" markdown="1">
<br>
<p>When not in lab-proper, I am often in my own home-lab doing some sort of project - from building my own radio astronomy telescope to designing smart automation systems to manage my assorted miniature ecosystems.</p>

<p>When I do manage to remove myself from either lab, I often take much enjoyment in the great outdoors - nature's lab! I love gardening and grow most of my own vegetables and brew various beverages. I thoroughly enjoy backpacking and hiking, where I often return with a backpack full of interesting rocks.</p>

<p>I also exercise my crafty side through oil painting, metal work, and wood carving.</p> </div>
