## Plants and Gardening
<div class="div-1" markdown="1">
<br>
<p>I've always have had a fondness for things that grow and plants are no exception. My parents would often have to listen to my constant whining whenever they took me to the grocery store, as I would always go to the weird fruit section and insist that they'd buy me a new-to-me fruit. They'd ask if I wanted to actually eat it and I would say yes, but really all I wanted were the seeds to plant. This was certainly not helped by having a large 50x50ft garden that I tended with my dad since I could walk.</p>

<p>Thus I've always enjoyed growing plants and have never let silly things such as "living in a windowless dorm" or "sub-optimal climates" stop me. </p>

<p>I really enjoy growing plants that have a purpose, particularly those with historical contexts. For example, one year I grew indigo and made my own dye to then dye the cotton and flax that I grew next to it! I find it fun to explore <em> what it takes </em> to make many commodities that we take for granted today.</p>

<p> I have many rare succulents, many endangered, that adorn my patio. I am especially interested in xerophytes (which thrive here in the hot Central Valley). My collection also spans many carnivorous plants and some tropicals, mainly spices such a pepper and coffee.</p>

## Critters

<p>Ever since I was a child, I've always had the company of multitudes of critters. When traipsing out in the forest, I'd often catch and try to smuggle snakes into the house, much to the horror of my mom. My current roomates consist of four cockatiels, Nico and Jojo, and Knick Knack and Robbie. I also have a rainforest vivarium that houses a trio of dart frogs and a 15 gallon reef aquarium.</p>

<p> To the right is Nico (Copernicus), the most mischievious of my tiels. His favorite pasttimes are to to chew wires, steal my food, and ride around on the ceiling fan.</p>
