  <p>Hi! My name's Tyler Erjavec and I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of California Davis where I study experimental physics, in particular rare-event detection experiments looking for dark matter and neutrinos!</p>

  <p>I grew up just noth of Cincinnati, Ohio where my parent's large 1.5 acre yard and accompanying forest provided me ample space and resources to explore the natural world. My dad is a geologist, so I have always had a - sometimes against my will - fondness for rocks. My mother maintains the artistic side of my family, and I attribute my forays into art and my predisposition to craftiness to her.</p>

<h2> Educational History </h2>
<div class="div-1">
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>For undergrad, I orginally was an aerospace engineering major at the University of Cincinnati. After one year, I'd decided that I wanted to pursue a Bachelors in physics instead and  then transferred to the Ohio State University. After graduating, I stuck around for a gap year to do research. Somewhat non sequitur-ly, I moved to Boston in 2016 where I worked with incoming Professor Kerstin Perez at MIT as a post-bac, building and running her lab spaces.</p>

  <p>In 2018 I moved to UCDavis where I am currently a PhD Candidate working under Prof. Emilija Pantic. I intend to pursue a post-doc after graduating, aiming to end up in a reaserch position at an academic-adjacent national laboratory.</p>
